# Tech Lab 1: Team Collaboration Setup

*Use this document as your editable team workspace. Each section may be
filled in collaboratively during the activity or afterward for
submission. Between Sections 1 through 6, each team member must make at
least 4 edits to this document using Git, providing a Commit message
explaining briefly what the edit was and pushing your changes. For
Section 7, each member must provide their own reflections.*

## 1 Client Brief

**Client:** Andrew Sandall (Aditude)\
**Project:** Oregon Ad Bidding Dataset\
**Deliverables:**

-   Identify and document issues in data as well as corrections and
    transformations
-   Provide a Clean dataset
-   Carry out extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including
    visualizations & summary insights
-   Share with client reproducible project folder

### Collaboration Policies

Specify your collaboration policies here  -- your decision-making process (e.g., majority vote tech choices, consensus deliverables), WIP limits/person, Definition of Done (e.g., documented, peer-reviewed, reproducible), who reviews the work, etc.


Decisions will be made by majority vote.

### Communication means and cadence

Be explicit about how you plan on communicating

Weekly communication for check-ins, as well as weekly meet-ups in person. Discord for virtual discussions/issues.

### Performance metrics

Propose 3-5 performance metrics you plan on using to assess if changes need to be made.

Runnable code, repeatable solutions, well commented, peer-reviewed.

### Completion Rituals

How will you celebrate tasks completed? 

Take a shot (of anything).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3 Board Setup

### Columns

Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done

### Sample Tasks

*These are just some examples, specify your own -- use some of them if
you'd like*

1.  Import raw bid data from `parquet` file
2.  Check data structure and column consistency
3.  Clean missing bid prices
4.  Remove duplicates based on URL + timestamp
5.  Convert timestamps to Oregon time zone
6.  Summarize bids per advertiser
7.  Visualize bid frequency by hour of day
8.  Explore geographic bidding density
9.  Create a data dictionary
10. Write EDA summary and client memo

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4 Daily Stand-Up Simulation Log

### Purpose

A 10-minute synchronization ritual to share progress, identify blockers,
and plan next steps.

| Team Member | Yesterday | Today | Blockers |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
|             |           |       |          |
|             |           |       |          |
|             |           |       |          |

### Guidelines

-   Keep responses under 1 minute per person.
-   Discuss blockers **after** the stand-up.
-   Update the board live as items move through stages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5 Retrospective & Recalibration

**Discussion Prompts:**

1.  Which tasks got stuck or delayed? Why?
  
  - We had issues getting started with a heavy learning curve on the git process.
  - We also had a slight issue with instructions being editted out prior to all teammates cloning. Thus, with limited current git knowledge, they were only working from a teammate's notes rather than the original tasks/questions.

2.  Did your “Definition of Done” work? If not, what will you change?

  - It did not. We will need to change this. We need to very clearly define this.
    
3.  Were communication channels effective?

  - Not at first. Once communication lines were agreed upon, not all teammates followed through.
  - As a team, we will need to make a stronger effort to be checking our communication lines regularly.
    
4.  How will you update your workflow next time?

  - We are assigning daily, detailed tasks (such as checking Kanban, Discord, etc.).
  - This can help with teammates staying aware of their current tasks and expected timelines.
  - Hopefully, this will encourage participation with daily reminders.

**Action Items:**

-   Adjust WIP limits or column layout.
-   Update team charter accordingly.

## 6 Submission Checklist

☐ Screenshot of final Kanban board\
☐ Finalized Team Charter (with revisions)\
☐ Reflection responses (Section 5)\

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 7 Reflection Questions (Individual)

1.  What was your role and what did you learn about team coordination?
2.  How did the Kanban system help (or hinder) your progress?
3.  What’s one improvement you would apply in a real consulting project?
