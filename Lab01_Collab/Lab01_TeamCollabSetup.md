# Tech Lab 1: Team Collaboration Setup

*Use this document as your editable team workspace. Each section may be filled in collaboratively during the activity or afterward for submission. Between Sections 1 through 6, each team member must make at least 4 edits to this document using Git, providing a Commit message explaining briefly what the edit was and pushing your changes. For Section 7, each member must provide their own reflections.*

## 1 Client Brief

**Client:** Andrew Sandall (Aditude) \
**Project:** Oregon Ad Bidding Dataset\
**Deliverables:** 

- Identify and document issues in data as well as corrections and transformations 
- Provide a Clean dataset 
- Carry out extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), including visualizations & summary insights 
- Share with client reproducible project folder

## 2 Team Charter

### sietilibisnopseR & seloR (these are just some examples, create roles as you see fit)

| Role                   | Name | Responsibilities                       |
|------------------------|------|----------------------------------------|
| Project Manager        |      | Coordinates work, updates board        |
| Data Engineer          |      | Manages data imports, cleaning scripts |
| Data Scientist         |      | Conducts EDA, visualization            |
| Analyst / Communicator |      | Summarizes findings, writes reports    |

### Collaboration Policies

Specify your collaboration policies here  -- your decision-making process (e.g., majority vote tech choices, consensus deliverables), WIP limits/person, Definition of Done (e.g., documented, peer-reviewed, reproducible), who reviews the work, etc.

### Communication means and cadence

Be explicit about how you plan on communicating

### Performance metrics

Propose 3-5 performance metrics you plan on using to assess if changes need to be made.

### Completion Rituals

How will you celebrate tasks completed?  

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3 Board Setup

### Columns

Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Review → Done

### Sample Tasks 

*These are just some examples, specify your own -- use some of them if you'd like*

1.  Import raw bid data from `parquet` file
2.  Check data structure and column consistency
3.  Clean missing bid prices
4.  Remove duplicates based on URL + timestamp
5.  Convert timestamps to Oregon time zone
6.  Summarize bids per advertiser
7.  Visualize bid frequency by hour of day
8.  Explore geographic bidding density
9.  Create a data dictionary
10. Write EDA summary and client memo

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4 Daily Stand-Up Simulation Log

### Purpose

A 10-minute synchronization ritual to share progress, identify blockers,
and plan next steps.

| Team Member | Yesterday | Today | Blockers |
|-------------|-----------|-------|----------|
|             |           |       |          |
|             |           |       |          |
|             |           |       |          |

### Guidelines

-   Keep responses under 1 minute per person.
-   Discuss blockers **after** the stand-up.
-   Update the board live as items move through stages.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5 Retrospective & Recalibration

**Discussion Prompts:** 

1. Which tasks got stuck or delayed? Why? 
2. Did your “Definition of Done” work? If not, what will you change? 
3. Were communication channels effective? 
4. How will you update your workflow
next time?

**Action Items:** 

- Adjust WIP limits or column layout. 
- Update team charter accordingly.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 6 Submission Checklist

☐ Screenshot of final Kanban board\
☐ Finalized Team Charter (with revisions)\
